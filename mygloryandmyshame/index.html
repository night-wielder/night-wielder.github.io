Hey.</p>
<p>I’ve been so much blinded in self regret and guilt that I could
not think properly. But I feel like I have finally got my senses
back. And I feel like I should let you know something. I don’t
think it was such a bad idea to break up. I think it should both of
us.</p>
<p>I also want to let you know some of my final thoughts. If you’re
still filled with disgust, you can decide not to read. I’ll type
anyway. If you decide to read, please read the whole.</p>
<p>I think you have heard of a saying that goes like this, “Faults
are thick where love is thin”. I think this had a role to play in
what happened between us.</p>
<p>I think there are two plausible reasons as to why this
relationship broke. The first reason is that, you fell out of love.
The second reasons is that, you just suddenly had an elevated sense
of self respect. I think the first reason to be the accurate one.
Here’s how I think it happened.</p>
<p>You always had a high sense of self respect. But the mistakes I
made, you always saw them as trivial, since I was the person you
loved. You did mind when I did wrong to you, but you forgave me too.
You forgot, even. Because, you loved me. You let me believe I was not
such a bad person. You always talked about how good I was to you. Do
you remember? You didn’t let me think I was making mistakes. But
then, somehow you fell out of love. And you didn’t spare me again.
Every time I did something that angered you, you weren’t just
angry! You were out looking for vengeance.</p>
<p>That day, you were laughing and saying, “Amake kokhono bojhar
cheshta korso tumi? Ami keno raag kori bojhar cheshta korta? Khali
dekhso raag e kori.” Wait, didn’t I always encourage you to be
angry on me? But were you just angry? You admit it yourself, that you
are a vengeful one. Just take that Stranger Things incident for
example. I called you so many times that night. Did you pick it up?
Did your anger fade away next morning? No, you were taking revenge. I
really didn’t understand! I really didn’t think that would be the
case, that I would be your lover but not above your revengeful mind.
If I had understood you then, we would part our ways way sooner.</p>
<p>Okay, back to how we broke up. At one point, you even admitted you
loved me less. I don’t suppose I can tell you how that felt when I
heard that. Anyhow, since you started loving me less, you weren’t
just meeting up to my expectations. Because, you hardly felt anything
for me. And so, the mistakes that I had already made and you had
decided to spare me for, came back creeping in on your mind. There
was no more love, how could you spare me? You had to have revenge.
You took the one thing that mattered most to me. You hit me with
words that nobody had said to me before.</p>
<p>However, I don’t entirely think I didn’t deserve it. But I
also think it wasn’t fair to me. I was a bad person, yes. But you
put up with this same bad person for two years. Yes, I offered a
mentally challenged girl a hug, when she was crying. Yes I spoke some
very bad words when I was angry, when I was in despair. But I used to
be worse. I used to do worse things with your friends(M and T, if you
remember). I used to call them with flirtatious names. But you put up
with me anyway. I didn’t hate myself back then. I lived so happily,
with you and myself.</p>
<p>You said I disrespected you. Did I ever tell you I did not find
you pretty? I wrote poems for you, about how beautiful you were to
me. How much I loved your face, your voice, your everything. When I
was out of my mind, angry, I told you something bad about my friends.
It hurt your stature, I apologized. Trust me, I regretted it so so
much. But were you ever content thinking that, so what, they can
think whatever they want, my boyfriend found me so pretty? He was so
happy with me? I think not. I said things when I was out of my mind,
and you were looking for vengeance again.</p>
<p>You said I disrespected you everytime I got angry when you got
angry. I don’t think you were always just angry. Sometimes you
wanted to give punishments. (You don’t have to agree to that.
That’s what I think based on what I saw.) But, did you ever respect
my life and my hobbies? Respect me what I was, what I loved to do?</p>
<p>You know, you meant the world to me. I can’t ever tell you how
it felt when I saw, you weren’t meeting up to my expectations, not
calling me babu, not giving me much love. But still talking with your
friend, whom you know I don’t like very much, on a daily basis.
Every time I saw that it burned my heart. If you were just being
regular with me, it would not hurt that much. If you love someone
like I loved you, you would know what this would feel like.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is not to say I had no faults. I made mistakes way
more than you. I was just like that. But, you know what, you loved me
anyway. You kept on loving me for a long time. I wasn’t becoming
worse and worse. I stopped talking with most people because I just
loved so much to spend time with you. I forgot some of my hobbies.
But a person makes mistakes anyway. I made mistakes anyway. It cost
me dearly. But you admitted I was worse before. And in my heart, I
was trying to do better. So, why did you leave me? Was that fair to
me? Why did you decide to put up with me, to love me and make me love
you for two years?</p>
<p>I know what you must be thinking. Those “little things”. You
just got so much sick of me, right? But no, I don’t think it works
like that. When a person makes a wound, the wound heals up. When that
person makes another wound, the pain doesn’t compound. And it
doesn’t even hurt like it did before, because you get used to that.
Sometimes you accept. Sometimes you accept no one is perfect. You
decided to love me with those faults, right? Why leave me now? And
you know, sometimes there are some little good things too. Did they
compound on top of each other?</p>
<p>You said, I gave you a lesson. I got my lesson too. But you know,
I forgave myself. I forgave myself because I didn’t do anything
worse than I am capable of. I forgave myself because I know the
Senjuti from a year ago would forgive me easily. I forgave myself
because I know I’ll pick my words more carefully next time.  I
forgave myself because I regretted, and wanted to better. But
apparently, that wasn’t enough for you. You had to be revengeful.
Had to be “savage”. You had to obliterate those who hurt you.
You’re proud, aren’t you? I knew I wouldn’t be so good. That’s
why I had told you to be the better one of us, to be the forgiving
one of us.</p>
<p>Yes, my faults were thick. But sometimes I wish some of the better
things I had done had some more value.</p>
<p>Do you remember how I used to say, I was going to make you handle
some of my companies? Do you remember, that one time I said I
wouldn’t buy and gift you little things, I would buy shops for you.
How I always said how much I loved you. Your everything. How I asked
for your photos. Hugs. Kisses. Other stupid, imaginary, sometimes
obscene things. My poems, sketches – and other attempts to make you
happy and proud. Because I had you, I was just so happy. I told my
family. My sisters. They loved you too. How we talked about our mini
babu. How we had plans to go to Paris and other places. I wanted to
give the world to you.</p>
<p>They somehow now have no values at all. Maybe that’s how it’s
supposed to be.</p>
<p>I am a stranger to you now. You’re a stranger to me now too. I
don’t know this person at all. This person is just so full of
hatred. The person who loved me has surely died. I was just so wrong
in thinking, maybe she would melt after she saw my blood. I should
have known.  It was so childish. But what can I say, I thought if you
had some love left for me, surely you would forgive me.</p>
<p>But if the person who loved me is still there somewhere, I want to
tell you some things, like you told me in your letter. Bhalo kore
kheyo. Make a wonderful result. I hope you meet someone special who
can play guitars. If you’re sure he loves you, don’t fall out of
love. He might make mistakes, if he regrets, don’t punish him for
that. Be angry, then forgive (this is how I would do things, you can
do things your way, I’m just saying). I am still having a hard time
without you. Sleep doesn’t come. I sometimes sit on my bed and cry.
You keep appearing in my dreams. Yesterday, I saw the aliens attacked
our planet. I knew where you lived, and I flew to your place(I had
superpowers I guess) to protect you. But you were already fighting
them off by yourself. Bhalo theko tumi.</p>
<p>The stranger you, don’t get angry. I just wrote what I think. If
you want to call me and make angry replies to these, just stop. Let
me have my thoughts. But if the savage inside of you insists, we can
meet and you can yell all you want.</p>
<p>Farewell. Peace out.</p>
